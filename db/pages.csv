                    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is used for creating and visually representing a webpage.</p>
                    <p>HTML adds ""markup"" to standard English text. ""Hyper Text"" refers to links that connect Web pages 
                    to one another, making the World Wide Web what it is today. By creating and uploading Web pages 
                    to the Internet, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML supports visual images 
                    and other media as well. With the help of HTML everyone can make static as well as dynamic web sites.</p>
                    <p>HTML is the language that describes the structure and the semantic content of a web document. 
                    Content within a web page is tagged with HTML elements such as <b>&#60;img&#62;</b>, <b>&#60;title&#62;</b>, 
                    <b>&#60;p&#62;</b>, <b>&#60;div&#62;</b>, <b>&#60;picture&#62;</b>, and so forth. These elements form

From alternative medicine techniques I chose The Bowen Therapy Techniquealso known as Bowtech, which is a dynamic system of muscle and connective tissue therapy that was developed by Tom Bowen in Australia. This technique can provide relief for many types of injuries and other health problems, both acute and chronic, and it does so holistically, via the body's innate healing mechanisms.
While there are a few, very specific situations in which a particular 'Bowen procedure' is contraindicated, Bowen Technique is appropriate for people of all ages, in all degrees of health. Rather than focusing on a single complaint, Bowen Technique addresses the entire body, by restoring balance via the autonomic nervous system (ANS).
The ANS controls over 80% of bodily functions and is very susceptible to external stressors. Most people today live in a constant state of high stress and sympathetic ANS over-stimulation (fight, run or freeze mode). Healing can occur only after the ANS shifts from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance (rest, relax and repair mode). Bowen Technique enables that shift. During a session, the client often drops into deep relaxation. That change is the indicator of a profound release from stress and a shift towards parasympathetic influence.

<!--                    <p>They helped me a lot to improve my listening and speaking fluency in English.<br></p>
                    <p>Thank you!<br/></p> 
-->
                    <p>Deep English is founded by Dan and Aaron. Here's what they say about themselves and about their project.<br/></p>
                    <p> With Master's degrees in teaching English and online learning, and years of experience teaching English at the 
                    university level, we are confident in our abilities to help you take your 
                    English speaking and listening to the next level.</p>
                    <h4>Real World English</h4>
                    <p>Over the years we have seen three main problems for English learners: 
                    boring materials, ineffective learning methods, and lack of time to attend classes. 
                    We decided to make something different.
                    We wanted to create something new and meaningful for people like us. 
                    People who love to learn, love to laugh, and are always looking to experience 
                    the world with fresh eyes.
                    Our mission is to get you passionate about using English to communicate and understand 
                    real, meaningful ideas. To do that, we created a different kind of English lesson, built around 
                    interesting subjects that make people think deeply.</p>
                    <h4>Vision</h4>
                    <p>We are here to make a difference. It may sound ""corny"" but we believe that 
                    every person has an opportunity to make the world a better place. 
                    Sending ripples of positivity into the world is something we all have a chance
                     to do regardless of what kind of job we have. We are English teachers, so we try 
                    to do this by making lessons that inspire people to grow, live life more fully, 
                    and think about the world in new ways.</p>
                    <h4>Mission</h4>
                    <p>Our mission is to help you reach your English fluency goals. To do that, 
                    we have to give you a shot of raw honesty: Deep English isn't for everyone. 
                    We have created our lessons for people who are open-minded and 
                    ready to make the jump to English fluency. This isn't for beginners.
                    Are Deep English lessons right for you? There is only one way to find out. 
                    Over the past 4 years we have created a library of free listening lessons 
                    and a free 7-day course teaching our method of how to improve 
                    your listening and speaking fluency.<br/></p>
