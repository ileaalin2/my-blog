(3, 'aboutme', 'About me Page', 'The Bowen Technique\n\nFrom alternative medicine techniques I chose The Bowen Therapy Techniquealso known as Bowtech, which is a dynamic system of muscle and connective tissue therapy that was developed by Tom Bowen in Australia. This technique can provide relief for many types of injuries and other health problems, both acute and chronic, and it does so holistically, via the body''s innate healing mechanisms.\nWhile there are a few, very specific situations in which a particular ''Bowen procedure'' is contraindicated, Bowen Technique is appropriate for people of all ages, in all degrees of health. Rather than focusing on a single complaint, Bowen Technique addresses the entire body, by restoring balance via the autonomic nervous system (ANS).\nThe ANS controls over 80% of bodily functions and is very susceptible to external stressors. Most people today live in a constant state of high stress and sympathetic ANS over-stimulation (fight, run or freeze mode). Healing can occur only after the ANS shifts from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance (rest, relax and repair mode). Bowen Technique enables that shift. During a session, the client often drops into deep relaxation. That change is the indicator of a profound release from stress and a shift towards parasympathetic influence.'),
