        <h2>Here it'll be some text about me, but for the moment IT'S ALL ABOUT HTML.</h2>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is used for creating and visually representing a webpage.</p>
        <p>HTML adds "markup" to standard English text. "Hyper Text" refers to links that connect Web pages 
        to one another, making the World Wide Web what it is today. By creating and uploading Web pages 
        to the Internet, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML supports visual images 
        and other media as well. With the help of HTML everyone can make static as well as dynamic web sites.</p>
        <p>HTML is the language that describes the structure and the semantic content of a web document. 
        Content within a web page is tagged with HTML elements such as <b>&#60;img&#62;</b>, <b>&#60;title&#62;</b>, 
        <b>&#60;p&#62;</b>, <b>&#60;div&#62;</b>, <b>&#60;picture&#62;</b>, and so forth. These elements form 
        the building blocks of a website.</p>
